# tic-tac-toe-game
This Tic Tac Toe game is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a simple and interactive two-player experience, featuring dynamic board updates, win condition checks, and a game restart option.

The project highlights my skills in front-end development, JavaScript logic building, and user interface design.
